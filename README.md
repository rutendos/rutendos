## Hello! I'm Rutendo!

I'm a Computational Biologist who enjoys tackling various biological problems using Statistical Methods and Machine Learning. I'm also passionate about the learning process and learning new skills! 

I've contributed to various projects that include:

1. Development of [TFEA](https://github.com/Dowell-Lab/TFEA), a tool to determine transcription factor activity from nascent RNA sequencing data.
2. Apply [signal processing and machine learning techniques](https://github.com/rutendos/genome_wavelets/blob/master/Rocky2019_Sigauke_Slides.pdf) to predict nascent RNA sequencing experiments from the raw data.
3. Build a database ([DBNascent](https://nascent.colorado.edu/home/)) of nascent RNA sequencing experiments across 20 organisms.
4. Applying [statistical analyses](https://github.com/Dowell-Lab/bidir_gene_pairs/tree/windowed_correlations) to determine regulatory regions linked to genes in human tissues.
5. [Whiptail lizard](https://elifesciences.org/articles/97035) genomes 🦎 analyses. I contributed to the analysis of the synteny of the genomes and the repeat element content of the genomes. 

In my free time, I enjoy drawing and painting.

In the last couple of years, I've also picked up running 🏃‍♀️. My goal is to increase mileage each year 😅.
